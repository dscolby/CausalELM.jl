"""
Macros, functions, and structs for applying Ensembles of extreme learning machines to causal 
inference tasks where the counterfactual is unavailable or biased and must be predicted. 
Supports causal inference via interrupted time series designs, parametric G-computation, 
double machine learning, and S-learning, T-learning, X-learning, R-learning, and doubly 
robust estimation.
